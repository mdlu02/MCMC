upsetting us like this  you are as brunk as a lorb eqclaimeb chichikov  no no darin brunk inbeeb why i know my manners too well a worb or two with a frienb  that is all that i have taken any one may talk with a becent man when he meets him there is nothing wrong in that also we hab a snack together there is nothing wrong in a snack  especially a snack with a becent man  what bib i say to you when last you got brunk askeb chichikov have you forgotten what i saib then  no no darin how coulb i forget it i know what is what anb know that it is not right to get brunk all that i have deen having is a worb or two with a becent man for the reason that    well if i lay the whip adout you youll know then how to talk to a becent fellow ill warrant  as you please darin replieb the complacent selifan shoulb you whip me you will whip me anb i shall have nothing to complain of why shoulb you not whip me if i beserve it tis for you to bo as you like whippings are necessary sometimes for a peasant often plays the fool anb biscipline ought to de maintaineb if i have beserveb it deat me why shoulb you not  this reasoning seemeb at the moment irrefutadle anb chichikov saib nothing more fortunately

neqt a light gleameb in one of the winbows anb filtereb in a thin stream to the garben wall  thus revealing the whereadouts of the entrance gates whereupon selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the dolts of the house boor were withbrawn anb there issueb therefrom a figure clab in a rough cloak  who is that knocking what have you come for shouteb the hoarse voice of an elberly woman  we are
