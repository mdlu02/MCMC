iwnbherascugfoz tpykvqjmxld: ihe side of the britchka while chichikov tumbled and floundered about in the mud in a vain endeavour to wriggle clear of the stuff  ah you said selifan meditatively to the britchka to think of upsetting us like this  you are as drunk as a lord ejclaimed chichikov  no no barin drunk indeed why i know my manners too well a word or two with a friend  that is all that i have taken any one may talk with a decent man when he meets him there is nothing wrong in that also we had a snack together there is nothing wrong in a snack  especially a snack with a decent man  what did i say to you when last you got drunk asked chichikov have you forgotten what i said then  no no barin how could i forget it i know what is what and know that it is not right to get drunk all that i have been having is a word or two with a decent man for the reason that    well if i lay the whip about you youll know then how to talk to a decent fellow ill warrant  as you please barin replied the complacent selifan should you whip me you will whip me and i shall have nothing to complain of why should you not whip me if i deserve it tis for you to do as you like whippings are necessary sometimes for a peasant often plays the fool and discipline ought to be maintained if i have deserved it beat me why should you not  this reasoning seemed at the moment irrefutable and chichikov said nothing more fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair for from afar their ears caught the barking of a dog plucking up courage chichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted and the horses to be urged forward and since a russian driver has at least this merit that owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place of eyesight he can if necessary drive at random and yet reach a destination of some sort selifan succeeded though powerless to discern a single obzect in directing his steeds to a country house near by and that with such a certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts had collided with a garden wall and thereby made it clear that to proceed another pace was impossible that he stopped all that chichikov could discern through the thick veil of pouring rain was something which resembled a verandah so he dispatched selifan to search for the entrance gates and that process would have lasted indefinitely had it not been shortened by the circumstance that in russia the place of a swiss footman is frequently taken by watchdogs of which animals a number now proclaimed the travellers presence so loudly that chichikov found himself forced to stop his ears nejt a light gleamed in one of the windows and filtered in a thin stream to the garden wall  thus revealing the whereabouts of the entrance gates whereupon selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the bolts of the house door were withdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure clad in a rough cloak  who is that knocking what have you come for shouted the hoarse voice of an elderly woman  we are travellers good mother said chichikov pray allow us to spend the night here  out upon you for a pair of gadabouts retorted the old woman a fine time of night to be arriving we dont keep an hotel mind you this is a ladys residence  but what are we to do mother we have lost our way and cannot spend the night out of doors in such weather  no we cannot the night is dark and cold added selifan  hold your tongue you fool ejclaimed chichikov  who are you then inquired the old woman  a dvorianin  good mother  somehow the word dvorianin seemed to give the old woman food for thought  wait a moment she said and i will tell the mistress  two minutes later she returned with a lantern in her hand the gates were opened and a light glimmered in a second window entering the courtyard the britchka halted before a moderate sixed mansion the darkness did not permit of very accurate observation being made but apparently the windows only of one half of the building were illuminated while a quagmire in front of the door reflected the beams from the same meanwhile the rain continued to beat sonorously down upon the wooden roof and could be heard trickling into a water butt nor for a single moment did the dogs cease to bark with all the strength of their lungs one of them throwing up its head kept venting a howl of such energy and duration that the animal seemed to be howling for a handsome wager while another cutting in between the yelpings of the first animal kept restlessly reiterating like a postmans bell the notes of a very young puppy finally an old hound which appeared to be gifted with a peculiarly robust temperament kept supplying the part of contrabasso so that his growls resembled the rumbling of a bass singer when a chorus is in full cry and the tenors are rising on tiptoe in their efforts to compass a particularly high note and the whole body of choristers are wagging their heads before approaching a climaj and this contrabasso alone is tucking his bearded chin into his collar and sinking almost to a squi
