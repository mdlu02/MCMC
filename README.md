# MCMC
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Substitution Cipher Decoder

This repository includes the code and text libraries to run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for deciphering scrambled texts prepared using a substitution cipher. The algorithm is based on the Metropolis Hasings algorith, a variant of the MCMC class of algorithms. The algorithm approximates the substitution permutation used the encode the original text.
